Run full cycle verify example:
First create a BlackPearl target storage location using the GUI
or API. The test location will clone that to acquire credentials.

The full_cycle command will write status to the console at each task. 
Steps which must wait for tasks to complete  will print a period (.) to the console each attempt.
